# screenshoo

## Motivation 
Have you ever, having spent a day blithely `cmd+shift+4'ing`, come back to your desktop only to be greeted by an atrocious, cluttered desktop?! Did *you* have far too much time on your hands this morning?

## Enter screenshoo.
Screenshoo is a (probably over-engineered, probably broken) solution to this untenable state of affairs.
