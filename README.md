# screenshoo

## Motivation 
Have you ever, having spent a day blithely `cmd+shift+4'ing`, come back to your desktop only to be greeted by an atrocious, cluttered desktop?! Did *you* have far too much time on your hands this morning?

## Enter screenshoo.
Screenshoo is a (probably over-engineered, probably broken) solution to this untenable state of affairs.

## Usage/Config
You'll need to `pip3 install` the `os`, `schedule`, and `time` modules as necessary.

The only other config, as far as I'm aware, is to modify the following lines in `screenshoo.py`:

`path = "/Users/jaredjewell/Desktop" #path to your desktop`
`dirname = "!#&$ screenshots"        #name of the dump dir`
